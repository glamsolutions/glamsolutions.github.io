            <h5>Client</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Transportation and Infrastructure Planning division of York Region’s Transportation Services department.</p>
            <h5>Problem Definition</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">To assist regional staff in determining critical transportation infrastructure assets that are currently at risk of damage during flood events. The process also identifies assets for priority intervention based on their criticality in the infrastructure system. </p>
            <h5>Objectives</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">To develop desktop tools and web solutions (Dashboard & Geocortex 5 Web Viewer) to be used by York Region staff for assessing design standards for asset types in floodplain locations.</p>
            <h5>Technology Used</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">ArcGIS Technology (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Online) and Geocortex 5 Web</p>

    <div class="content2">
        <div class="w3-third extrapadr">
            <h1>Data Pre-Processing</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-16">The data required some manipulation to be ready for the spatial analysis process.</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">This included clipping the outliers of the assets located outside of York Region to prevent erroneous results. The multiple flood-related data layers that were provided initially were consolidated into a single floodplain and any asset layers missing a corresponding road segment identifier had to be matched with one to facilitate the calculation of criticality.</p>
            <h4>Data Assumptions</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">It is assumed that these asset layers all contain a field called “SEGMENTID” which identifies what regional road they are nearest to. Finally, the user only wishes to compare an asset layer against a single floodplain layer.</p>
            <h4>Transportation Assets</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Some of the asset data received from the client already had a segment ID but any that did not was run through a one-to-one Spatial Join with the asset as the target feature, the regional road data as the join feature, the Closest match option, and the only output field inherited from the road layer as SEGMENTID. For the two asset layers that contained features positioned well away from regional roads (trnBusStop and trnYRTHub), a search radius of 100 metres was included when running the spatial join to prevent criticality from being falsely inflated by assets that do not actually exist near the road segment. </p>

            <img src="images/FloodplainMapFull.jpg" alt="Data Before and After">
            <h4>Floodplains</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Three of the flood-related layers acquired from the client were filtered and combined to create a single floodplain that represented the inundated area in the worst-case flooding scenario for the whole region. Since two different conservation authorities assembled the flood data, there were some notable differences in the datasets that required them to be initially processed separately.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The data from TRCA delineated worst-case scenario flood polylines. To produce a TRCA floodplain, edits were made to the data to close any open polylines under the assumption that a straight-line connection between endpoints was acceptable. The “must not have dangles” topological rule was implemented to catch any residual open polylines. Then, the flood lines layer was run through the Feature to Polygon tool to produce a floodplain. The flood data from LSRCA was split between two different layers, The two layers were filtered then merged and, as with the TRCA data, a field was added and populated to store the name of the source conservation authority.   </p>

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In order to provide the client with an iterative process for identifying criticality and flood vulnerable assets, ArcGIS Pro was used to develop desktop ModelBuilder and Python tools to accomplish this.</h5>
            <h4>Find Flood Vulnerable Assets Tool</h4>

            <h4>Find Flood Vulnerable Assets Tool Development</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">This tool was developed over several iterations. The final version will take several asset layers, and one floodplain layer. It then adds a field for the AtRisk value if it does not already exist in the data. Then, it determines if the asset lies within the floodplain, and applies a value to the AtRisk field, 0 for Not At Risk, and 1 if it is at risk of flooding.</p>
            <h4>Criticality Ranking Tool Development</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Criticality Ranking Tool takes several asset layers, and one road layer as input, and identifies the total number of assets along a given segment of Road. This total is the Criticality Ranking, and is used to prioritize resource allocations for roads that are most critical.</p>

            <h4>Application Design</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Collection keeps the light colour theme of both the Web Viewer and Dashboard products and makes use of a prominent shade of blue from York Region's logo as the accent colour for consistency.</p>

            <h4>Development Process</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Configuration of the StoryMap Collection was very simple. In a new Collection template, the two applications were added as ArcGIS Content with appropriate thumbnails and titles. The default “Grid” layout option was kept and the Navigation style was set to the tabbed option so the application titles would be displayed in the final collection.</p>

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">York Region requested a web map viewer to allow easy exploration of the spatial data relevant to the flood and criticality analyses. Geocortex 5 Web was selected as the optimal platform based on availability and client preference.</h5>
            <h4>Functionality</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Web Viewer allows users to pan and zoom around the web map, identify features, draw, measure, and search for specific roads or road segments.</p>
            <h4>Application Design</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Web Viewer was built from an existing template offered by Geocortex and customized with changes to the layout, tool offerings, results display, and map search settings.</p>

            <h4>Development Process</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">A collection of widgets deemed potentially useful to transportation managers was selected for the toolbar at the top of the application. Other tools, like adding additional layers to the map and editing location notes were tucked into a drop-down menu. The search function was tweaked so that when a user searches a road segment ID, a list is provided of all assets with that same ID.</p>

            <h5 class="w3-padding-16">In order to effectively communicate the results of this project, ArcGIS Dashboards was used as it allows users to explore the data further with a web map, various widgets, and filters.</h5>
            <h4>Functionality</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">This Dashboard has several functions using widgets and elements that allow users to view and analyze the flood risk analysis results. This includes widgets such as a top 10 critical roads list, section to display number of flood vulnerable assets, municipality and road segment filters, and critical ranking indicator.</p>
            <h4>Application Design</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The layout of the application was designed to be visually appealing without overwhelming the user. This was to help users quickly see which information they want in a clear and concise format. It displays information while allowing the user some interactive options to further explore the data.</p>

        <h4>Development Process</h4>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">The first version of the Dashboard focused more on the application layout, rather than functionality. After receiving feedback from the client and advisor, the second version was developed and included further modifications in configuring widgets, elements and layout. These include displaying the vulnerable assets, configuring the web map and selectors, critical ranking indicator, regional roads list and more. After further edits were made, the third version was presented to the client and finalized.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">As climate change continues and flooding impacts worsen, transportation and infrastructure assets in York Region need to be evaluated to understand where there are potential risks. Before this project, there was no solution possessed by York Region to do so and these tools and applications resolve that. Our deliverables include the final web applications, technical documentation and the spatial analysis automated tools. </h5>
