            <h5>Client</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Transportation and Infrastructure Planning division of York Region’s Transportation Services department.</p>
            <h5>Problem Definition</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">To assist regional staff in determining critical transportation infrastructure assets that are currently at risk of damage during flood events. The process also identifies assets for priority intervention based on their criticality in the infrastructure system. </p>
            <h5>Objectives</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">To develop desktop tools and web solutions (Dashboard & Geocortex 5 Web Viewer) to be used by York Region staff for assessing design standards for asset types in floodplain locations.</p>
            <h5>Technology Used</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">ArcGIS Technology (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Online) and Geocortex 5 Web</p>

            <h1>Data Pre-Processing</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-16">The data required some manipulation to be ready for the spatial analysis process.</h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">This included clipping the outliers of the assets located outside of York Region to prevent erroneous results. The multiple flood-related data layers that were provided initially were consolidated into a single floodplain and any asset layers missing a corresponding road segment identifier had to be matched with one to facilitate the calculation of criticality.</p>
            <h4>Data Assumptions</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">It is assumed that these asset layers all contain a field called “SEGMENTID” which identifies what regional road they are nearest to. Finally, the user only wishes to compare an asset layer against a single floodplain layer.</p>
            <h4>Transportation Assets</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Some of the asset data received from the client already had a segment ID but any that did not was run through a one-to-one Spatial Join with the asset as the target feature, the regional road data as the join feature, the Closest match option, and the only output field inherited from the road layer as SEGMENTID. For the two asset layers that contained features positioned well away from regional roads (trnBusStop and trnYRTHub), a search radius of 100 metres was included when running the spatial join to prevent criticality from being falsely inflated by assets that do not actually exist near the road segment. </p>

            <img src="images/FloodplainMapFull.jpg" alt="Data Before and After">
            <h4>Floodplains</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Three of the flood-related layers acquired from the client were filtered and combined to create a single floodplain that represented the inundated area in the worst-case flooding scenario for the whole region. Since two different conservation authorities assembled the flood data, there were some notable differences in the datasets that required them to be initially processed separately.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The data from TRCA delineated worst-case scenario flood polylines. To produce a TRCA floodplain, edits were made to the data to close any open polylines under the assumption that a straight-line connection between endpoints was acceptable. The “must not have dangles” topological rule was implemented to catch any residual open polylines. Then, the flood lines layer was run through the Feature to Polygon tool to produce a floodplain. The flood data from LSRCA was split between two different layers, The two layers were filtered then merged and, as with the TRCA data, a field was added and populated to store the name of the source conservation authority.   </p>

            <h4>Find Flood Vulnerable Assets Tool Development</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">This tool was developed over several iterations. The final version will take several asset layers, and one floodplain layer. It then adds a field for the AtRisk value if it does not already exist in the data. Then, it determines if the asset lies within the floodplain, and applies a value to the AtRisk field, 0 for Not At Risk, and 1 if it is at risk of flooding.</p>
            <h4>Criticality Ranking Tool Development</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Criticality Ranking Tool takes several asset layers, and one road layer as input, and identifies the total number of assets along a given segment of Road. This total is the Criticality Ranking, and is used to prioritize resource allocations for roads that are most critical.</p>

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In this project, a StoryMap was used in a somewhat unconventional way. It was used as the housing for the two ArcGIS Online products that were created. This allows the user to stay on one page to view two different applications.</h5>
            <h4>Application Design</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">When dealing with the color theme for the web applications, it was ideal to base it on the current theme used by York Region which include shades of blue, white and gray. Using hexadecimal color codes for York Region’s logo, the elements, background and widgets were set to that color theme which complements the York Region brand.</p>

            <h4>Development Process</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Configuration of the StoryMap collection was very simple. In a new Collection template, the two applications were added as ArcGIS Content with appropriate thumbnails and titles. The default “Grid” layout option and a custom theme with York Region colours was used, and the Navigation style was set to the tabbed option so the application titles would be displayed in the final collection.</p>

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The use of this application was chosen since the client has a history of using Geocortex for a variety of past projects.</h5>
            <h4>Functionality</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey"> It allows for a more map-centric analysis where the user can add their own data into the application for a more in-depth analysis, along with other basic GIS functionality for spatial analysis.</p>
            <h4>Application Design</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Geocortex 5 Web viewer was the second web-based application requested by the client to facilitate exploration of the data related to the flood vulnerability analysis. An existing template offered by Geocortex was implemented as the starting point, then a number of changes to the layout, tool offerings, and map settings were made to customize the app</p>

            <h4>Development Process</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Although the overall layout of the template (docked pane, toolbar, single map window), was kept in place, a number of adjustments were made to improve ease of use. Some of the tools available in the top toolbar were swapped out to include only those most commonly used, namely the search bar and the identifying, measuring, drawing, and sharing widgets. Other tool options, such as adding location notes, loading/saving projects, or adding additional maps layers were made available in a collapsible button menu on the map window. Further details regarding changes can be found in the project report.</p>

            <h4>Functionality</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">This Dashboard has several functions using widgets and elements that allow users to view and analyze the flood risk analysis results. This includes a top 10 critical roads list, section to display flood vulnerable assets, municipal and road segment selector, critical ranking indicator and more. </p>
            <h4>Application Design</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The layout of the application was designed to be visually appealing in that each element was placed in an appropriate position. This is done to help users see which information they want in a clear and concise format, effectively convey information, not appearing overcrowded and more.</p>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">The first version of the Dashboard focused more on the application layout, rather than functionality. After receiving feedback from the client and advisor, the second version was developed and included further modifications in configuring widgets, elements and layout. These include displaying the vulnerable assets, configuring the web map and selectors, critical ranking indicator, regional roads list and more. After further edits were made, the third and final version was complete.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">As climate change continues and flooding impacts worsen, transportation and infrastructure assets in York Region need to be evaluated to understand where there are risks associated to flooding. Before this project, there was no solution possessed by York Region to do so and these tools and applications resolve that. Our deliverables includes the final web applications, technical documentation and the spatial analysis automated tools. </h5>
            <h3>Project Benefits</h3>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The following is a list of various benefits our project provides for York Region: </p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Provide client with foundation for start of using GIS for managing flood impacts to transportation assets</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Automated python tools for flood risk analysis to save the client time & effort</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Providing the client with a generalized criticality ranking for each of their road segments</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Help inform relevant parties in decisions related to the development and maintenance of transportation and infrastructure assets</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Support with the assessment of design standards for flood vulnerable transportation and infrastructure assets</p>
            <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">If time allowed, we would have like to consider some potential improvements to the solutions being presented:</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Undergoing a continuous maintenance process of the application to ensure it is still working fine</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Find ways to improve efficiency of tools (error handling, etc.)</p> 
                <p class="w3-text-grey">• Use of other platforms/applications to improve current product (such as Experience Builder)</p>
